# 👋 Assalamu Alaikum, I'm Yahye Asad Mousa
Full Stack Developer | Laravel & Vue.js | Focused on Secure and Scalable Web Solutions. <br>
I'm a full stack developer with a passion for building modern, reliable, and secure web applications. I work across the entire tech stack — from backend systems to interactive frontends — and I’m always learning and growing through real-world projects.

### Tech Stack
I specialize in building full stack applications using Laravel and PHP on the backend, complemented by Vue.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend. For data storage, I work primarily with MySQL and relational database design, and I use Redis for efficient caching and session handling. I’m also familiar with non-relational databases such as MongoDB, which I’ve used in projects requiring flexible document structures. My development workflow includes Git for version control, Docker for containerization, and CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments and testing.

### 📚 Currently Learning:
- AI & Machine Learning: Bringing intelligence into applications
- Web Security: Writing safe, secure, and resilient code
- Cloud & Distributed Systems: Scaling apps beyond a single server

### 🛠️ My Projects:
- TeachLab: A SaaS platform to manage student records (Laravel, Livewire)
- Event API: RESTful API for event and ticket management (Laravel, MySQL)
- Screen Recorder: A tool for recording screen and audio (Native PHP, Laravel)

### 🌱 What's Next:
- Deepening my skills in cloud-based development (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes)
- Contributing to meaningful open-source projects — especially in education and healthcare
